# FSRS
This is a collection of python code to process FSRS bottom temperatures collected by Nova Scotia lobstermen 1999-2019.
There is a pair of rather extensive googledocs that describe the work done in Jim Manning's lab circa 2017-2020 in an attempt to document, archive, and serve this valuable dataset.
One is called "eMOLT_FSRS_notes" (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VhBAl3sQAY0fMt66NVJWhwmiBJrTikGbu0k-grnCsmI/edit#) with logistics of merging the two datasets and one is called "eMOLT_FSRS_results"
(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SJTWRh412x-rjyTOST97Wf7yG5yx8i-Ao7hEZciMjO4/edit#) with some of the results.

You will see that the most useful code is from recent years (~2020) which deal with the raw hourly data derived from the original Minilog files.
The old code (<2018) was used to examine some of the other daily-averaged versions of the dataset that had been processed in various ways by various labs.
